# Self Hosting

Docker is currently the recommended and only supported way of running the Headbase server.  

## Using the Docker image

The docker image is published to the [Github Container Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry#about-the-container-registry)
and can be pulled like so:

```
docker pull ghcr.io/headbase-app/server
```

You can then run the image, however remember:
- You must supply all environment variables as defined in `packages/server/.env.example`.
- You will need to expose the port which matches the `PORT` environment variable you define, for example `-p 8080:8080`.

## Development

The `headbase-app/server` docker image is automatically created and published via GitHub actions when a tag with the pattern `server/**` is created or pushed.

### Manually creating the image
To manually create a docker image locally for testing you can do:

```
docker build . --tag headbase-server
```

### Run the image
```
docker run headbase-server -p 8080:8080
```
