# Plugins
The application provides a plugin system for extensibility. This system is used by built-in first-party tools and
allows you to add your own third-party tools too.

Plugins can:
- Register "editors" for given file patterns
- Read and write to the vault file system via the FileSystemAPI
- Use the MarkdownQueryAPI to run front-matter queries against markdown files in a given directory.
- Register custom application UI
