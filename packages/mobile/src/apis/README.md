# APIs
This folder contains API services used by the frontend application and third party plugins.
The `web` folder contains implementations for the web browser used for testing, and `mobile` contains the Android/iOS implementations used on device.

These are "vanilla" JavaScript services which are then separately integrated with framework-specific code.
The naming convention pattern used is "<x>API" for exposed features and "<x>Service" for internal services.
